abstract: "Reproduction attempt of B. Cichocki & K. Hinsen, Stokes drag on conglomerates
           of spheres, Phys. Fluids 7:286 (1995). A reproduction turned out to be
           impossible because important parts of the code could not be retrieved.
           However, the surviving code still works without modification."
